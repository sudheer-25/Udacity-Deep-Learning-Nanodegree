# Deep Learning Nanodegree

This repository contains my project solutions for the Deep Learning Nanodegree at Udacity. You can find the original exercises and project notebooks at [Deep Learning v2 Pytorch](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch) and [AWS SageMaker Deployment](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment).

## Project 1: Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns

In this project, I built a two layered neural network to predict daily bike rental ridership by implementing both forward and backward passes using Stochastic Gradient Descent. Model was trained on [UCI Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

## Project 2: Classifying Dog Breed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

In this project, I built a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed by using state-of-the-art CNN models for classification. If supplied an image of a human face, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. Model was trained on [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip) and [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).

## Project 3: TV Script Generation using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

In this project, I built an LSTM Neural Network Model that generates fake TV Script given a starting word. The model was trained on [Seinfeld Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv).

## Project 4: Face Generation Using General Adversarial Networks (GANs)

In this project, I built a DCGAN Model that generates new images of human faces. Trained both the Discriminator and Generator on [CelebA Dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html).

## Project 5: Deploying Sentiment Analysis Using AWS SageMaker

In this project, I built an LSTM Neural Network model to classify a review into positive/negative and deployed the model using AWS SageMaker Service and created a simple web app that interacts with the deployed model. The model was trained on [IMDB Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).
