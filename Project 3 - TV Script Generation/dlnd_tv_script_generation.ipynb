The error started off at around 10 and went down to 8 after 10 epochs. I have realized that 1 LSTM layer couldn't handle the text and used 2 LSTM layers along with a batch size of 64 as it was taking too much time for even 10 epochs. Error started off with 9 and went down to 7 after 5 epochs and after that it started oscillating. Hence, I have reduced the Learning rate to 0.005 and also increased the hidden dimension to 512 expecting to start off with a lower error. Error started off with 7 but it was still taking too much time just for 10 epochs. I then changed the learning rate to 0.001, embedding dimension to 100 and increased the batch size to 128 which gave me an error around 5 and went down to less than 3.5 by 9th epoch.\n"
